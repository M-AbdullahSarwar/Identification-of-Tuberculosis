#Project Summary<br/>
This repository contains code for an image classification project implemented using deep learning techniques. The project utilizes libraries commonly used in deep learning and image processing tasks, <br/>
including numpy, os, TensorFlow, OpenCV (cv2), Keras, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.<br/>

#Project Components:<br/>
Importing Necessary Libraries: The project begins with importing essential libraries required for deep learning and image processing tasks.<br/>
Defining the Model Architecture: The model architecture is defined using the Keras library, incorporating layers such as Dense, Input, InputLayer, and Flatten, essential for building a neural network.<br/>
Preprocessing and Data Preparation: While the specific code for preprocessing and data preparation is not provided in this document, it typically involves tasks such as loading and resizing images, <br/>
normalizing pixel values, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.<br/>
Model Training: The defined model architecture is used to train the image classification model. Further details regarding the dataset used and training parameters are not included in this document.<br/>
Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics: Post-training, the model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as classification report, confusion matrix, and F1 score, providing insights <br/> 
into its accuracy and classification capabilities.<br/>
Saving and Loading the Model: Once trained and evaluated, the model is saved to a file using Keras' model-saving functionality, enabling reuse without retraining.<br/>
